# Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) (AXI-Stream) on FPGA

This repository provides a **reference RTL implementation** of a
**two-channel Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) analysis/synthesis filter bank**
implemented in **Verilog** and integrated with **AXI-Stream**.

Target platform: **AMD Kria KV260**  
Focus: **RTL architecture, fixed-point DSP decisions, and AXI correctness**

Real-time, continuous streaming design with deterministic latency.

---

## Overview

This module implements:

* **Function**: QMF-based subband analysis and synthesis
* **Data type**: Fixed-point (Q15)
* **Scope**: Minimal, single-purpose DSP building block

The design is intentionally **not generic** and **not feature-rich**.  
It exists to demonstrate **how a QMF filter bank is implemented in hardware**,  
not to provide a turnkey audio codec or framework.

---

## Key Characteristics

* RTL written in **Verilog**
* **AXI-Stream** data interface
* **AXI-Lite** control interface for coefficient loading and enable
* Fixed-point arithmetic with explicit bit-width control
* Deterministic, cycle-accurate behavior
* Designed and verified for **real-time audio streaming**
* No runtime software included

Design notes:

* Analysis and synthesis stages are implemented as **separate RTL cores**
* FIR filtering is used explicitly for clarity and determinism
* Coefficients are programmable at runtime via AXI-Lite
* No hidden buffering or implicit multirate logic is used

---

## Data Format

* AXI-Stream width: **32-bit**
* Fixed-point format: **Q1.15**
* Channel layout:
  * `[15:0]`   → Left channel (signed)
  * `[31:16]`  → Right channel (signed)

At the core level, all processing is performed using signed 16-bit samples.

---

## Latency

* **Fixed processing latency**
* Latency is:
  * deterministic
  * constant
  * independent of input signal characteristics

This behavior is intentional and suitable for streaming DSP pipelines where
predictable timing is required.

---

## Verification & Validation

Verification was performed at two levels.

### 1. RTL Simulation

Dedicated testbenches validate:

* Subband separation behavior
* Reconstruction correctness
* Fixed-point numerical stability
* AXI-Stream handshake correctness
* AXI-Lite register read/write behavior

Simulation outputs are logged to CSV files for **offline waveform inspection**.

---

### 2. Hardware Validation

The design was **tested on real FPGA hardware**.

> **Tested on FPGA hardware via PYNQ overlay**

PYNQ was used strictly as:
* a signal stimulus source
* an observability/debug tool

No PYNQ software, Python scripts, or runtime dependencies are included
in this repository.

---

## Reference Filter

This implementation uses the **Johnston 8A QMF prototype filter**
as a validation reference:

> James D. Johnston,  
> *A filter family designed for use in quadrature mirror filter banks*,  
> IEEE ICASSP, 1980.

The filter is used to:
* validate subband separation
* observe reconstruction behavior
* evaluate fixed-point implementation quality

It is **not presented as an optimal or modern design**.

---

## What This Repository Is

* A **clean RTL reference**
* A demonstration of:
  * DSP reasoning
  * fixed-point trade-offs
  * AXI-Stream / AXI-Lite integration
* A building block for larger FPGA audio pipelines

---

## What This Repository Is Not

* ❌ A complete audio system
* ❌ A codec or compression framework
* ❌ A parameter-heavy generic IP
* ❌ A software-driven demonstration

The scope is intentionally constrained.

---

## Design Rationale (Summary)

Key design decisions include:

* FIR-based QMF for explicit and debuggable behavior
* Johnston 8A coefficients for literature-backed validation
* Fixed-point arithmetic with explicit scaling
* Separate core and AXI wrapper layers for clarity

These choices reflect **engineering trade-offs**, not missing features.

---

## Integration Overview

This repository also includes a **system-level integration** of:

QMF Analysis  
→ Independent subband gain (low / high)  
→ QMF Synthesis

The integration demonstrates that:

- QMF analysis and synthesis operate correctly as a streaming pair
- Subband-domain processing can be inserted without breaking timing
- Multiple AXI-Stream modules can be chained without deadlock
- AXI-Stream data paths and AXI-Lite control paths remain cleanly separated

Integration is validated using an RTL testbench with explicit wiring,
robust handshake handling, and offline waveform inspection.

This integration is provided as a **reference architecture**, not as a
complete audio system or reusable framework.

---

## Dependencies

This repository builds on the following previously published RTL modules:

- **FIR Stereo Core**  
  https://github.com/vrm-lab/FIR-Stereo-FPGA  
  Used as the underlying FIR engine for the QMF analysis and synthesis filters.

- **Audio Gain Module**  
  https://github.com/vrm-lab/Audio-Gain-Module-FPGA  
  Used in the integration example to demonstrate subband-domain gain processing.

These dependencies are included as RTL sources in this repository for
completeness and reproducibility.

The external links are provided to document module lineage and design
context, not as runtime or build-time requirements.

---

## Project Status

This repository is considered **complete**.

* RTL is stable
* Functional verification is complete
* Hardware validation has been performed
* No further feature expansion is planned

The design is published as a **reference implementation**.
